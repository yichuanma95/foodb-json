# foodb-json
A JSON API for the FooDB database.

Data source: www.foodb.ca. Data was last updated on 7 April 2020.

The data for this API consists of food data from FooDB, except that there are compound contents for each food item in
this data. This data was generated with my Jupyter notebook, but it took a while to generate (~2 hours), so I have it
saved and stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
